            Congratulations, your song is on Spotify. As an artist this marks
            the official start of your career. And all your hard work will soon
            be paid off. But to how much money are you entitled to?

            The music industry is a complicated industry with many confusing
            things. Because of this a lot of questions arise. Unfortunately
            there are no short and simple answers and the answer can change case
            by case.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repertoire wants to solve some of these problems by addressing the
            entire flow from musical work, sound recordings, licensing and
            rights associated with payment flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of starting from the beginning when the song was written and
            recorded, we will start with the finished song on Spotify. We do
            this so we can literally follow the money back to the artists.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Digital radio</h2>
          <p>
            So your song is on Spotify, an
            <span>interactive digital radio</span>. This means that a listener
            can control which song they want to listen and in what order, at any
            moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When listening to the radio a big difference arises between digital
            radio and terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is a classic FM or AM
            radio where a dj chooses the song and the listener can only listen
            to those songs, it’s a non-interactive process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The digital radio is radio via the internet and is divided between
            the interactive radio and the
            <span>non-interactive digital radio</span>. Non-interactive radio
            works the same as terrestrial radio. It won’t let the user choose
            what songs to listen to and in what order.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Record label</h2>
          <p>
            Okay, now that we know more about what Spotify actually is, we can
            take a look at how the royalties are divided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interactive digital radio, like Spotify needs to pay the
            copyright holders of the recording, which in most cases is the
            <span>record label</span>. These are called recording performance
            royalties. The record label will also have to pay songwriter and
            composer, royalties earned for each record sale, they are called
            mechanical license fees. If the songwriter and composer are the same
            person as the performer all these royalties go to the same person
            via a different way.

        <article class="performer">
          <h3 id="section-heading-four">04</h3>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Performer</h2>
          <p>
            So Spotify paid fees to the record label, but the artist still isn’t
            paid. Luckily this is a fairly straight process. The
            <span>performer</span> signs to a record label, and gets studio time
            to record the song from the record label. Depending on the contract
            the performer can get a lot of different perks from the record
            label. They could also record a video clip for the song, promote the
            song and pay for a tour for instance. The record label gets in
            return the royalties of the song. The record label then pays the
            performer back a portion of the money they receive. The amount the
            performer gets depends on the contract they sign. This explanation
            has been very zoomed in on every individual of this story, but for a
            better overview this graphic might help!

              Repertoire has created a blockchain solution where performers,
              composers and songwriters can upload a new piece of information
              whenever it is created. This information can be a sound recording,
              a melody, just the recording of the piano or even just some
              lyrics. It can be anything that has just been created. The whole
              idea behind this is that this information is safely secured
              somewhere to avoid legal issues in the future. It’s the perfect
              way to stay in your creative flow but still be done with the legal

            Now that we have taken a look at the record label side of the story,
            we can dive into the publisher, songwriter and composer side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spotify also needs to pay royalties to the songwriters, composers
            and music publishers. These payments go to the
            <span>Performance Rights Organizations (PRO’s)</span> first. PRO’s
            are organizations who negotiate and collect royalties when
            songwriters and composers’ songs are publicly performed in a
            broadcast, on the internet, or a physical live performance. These
            payments are songwriting performance royalties. In America ASCAP,
            BMI and SESAC are PRO’s.

        <article class="music-publisher">
          <h3 id="section-heading-six">06</h3>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Music publisher</h2>
          <p>
            The party who signs up to a PRO’s is the
            <span>music publisher</span>. The reason they do this is so their
            songwriters and composers get their performance royalties. So what
            does the music publisher do? The music publisher’s job is to market
            and promote the songwriters and composers songs resulting in
            exposure. They pitch the songs to record labels, television
            producers, etc. When the music publisher finds someone who’s
            interested in using the song or lyrics they also license the rights
            over so the other party can use the song or lyrics and the music
            publisher can collects the money for the usages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically the music publisher takes over the possessions of the
            copyrights so they can collect the royalties themself and later pay
            a agreed opon portion back to the writers/composers.

              Whenever a songwriter or composer needs to get payed, it will be
              easily traceable who worked on the music even if it accidentally
              happens that a composer or songwriter is excluded. This is because
              the piece of information where this composer or songwriter had
              worked on is uploaded on Repertoire and due to the use of
              blockchain information can’t be altered without being noticed by

            Now we have finally come down to the creation of the song, the job
            of the <span>songwriter</span> and the <span>composer</span>. When a
            songwriter writes a song or a composer composes a song they can sign
            with a music publisher. There are a many different contracts they
            can sign. Contracts differ in services the music publisher will do
            for the songwriter and composer. Of course there will also be a
            difference in the percentage the music publisher keeps for
            themselves. Traditionally the split is 50-50 in the USA. In Europe
            this split is 33-33-33. This explanation has been very zoomed in on
            every individual of this story, but for a better overview this
