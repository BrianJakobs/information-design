            We believe that a decentralized information management framework is
            needed to fill the gaps in the music industry. Collectively governed
            with and by the industry itself. This is what we are building.

            There is a huge demand for a decentralized storage related to music
            copyright. We belief that at the core an open decentralized ledger
            for copyright information is needed, allowing others to build layers
            and third party services on top of this. We have have been
            developing blockchain technology since 2013, including building an
            industry-wide ecosystem permissioned blockchain, a new
            cryptocurrency, and having been key to aligning over a hundred
            companies in the copyright and licensing industry to share data
            between each other. We are based in Amsterdam (Netherlands) and
            Stockholm (Sweden).
