            The music industry is a complicated industry with many confusing
            things. Because of this a lot of questions arise. Unfortunately
            there are no short and simple answers and the answer can change case
            by case. Instead of starting from the beginning when the song was
            written and recorded, we will start with the finished song on
            Spotify. We do this so we can literally follow the money back to the
            artists.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Digital radio</h2>
          <p>
            So your song is on Spotify, an Interactive digital radio. This means
            that a listener can control which song they want to listen and in
            what order at any moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When listening to the Radio a big difference arises between Digital
            radio and Terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is a classic FM or AM
            Radio where a dj chooses song and the listener can only listen to
            those songs, it’s a non-interactive process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Digital radio is radio via the internet and is divided between
            the Interactive radio and the Non-interactive radio. Non-interactive
            radio works the same as Terrestrial radio. It won’t let the user
            choose what songs to listen to and in what order.

          <h2 class="section-heading">Record label</h2>
          <p>
            Okay, now that we know more about what Spotify actually is, we can
            take a look at how the royalties are divided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Interactive digital radio, like Spotify, has to pay royalties to
            the Songwriters, Composers and Music publishers. These payments
            first go to Performance Rights Organization (PRO’s). PRO’s are
            organizations who negotiate and collect royalties when Songwriters
            and Composers’ songs are publicly performed in a broadcast, on the
            internet, or a physical live performance. These payments are
            performance royalties. In America ASCAP, BMI and SESAC are PRO’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spotify also needs to pay the copyright holders of the recording,
            which in most cases is the Record label.

        <article class="name-section">
          <h3 id="section-heading-four">04</h3>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Performer</h2>
          <p>
            The party who signs up to a PRO’s is the Music Publisher. The reason
            they do this is so their Songwriters and Composers get their
            Performance royalties. So what does the Music publisher do? The
            Music Publisher’s job is to market and promote the Songwriters and
            Composers songs resulting in exposure. They pitch the songs to
            Record Labels, Television producers, etc. When the Music publisher
            found someone who’s interested in using the song or lyrics they also
            license the rights over so the other party can use the song or
            lyrics and the Music publisher can collects the money for the
            usages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically the Music publisher takes over the possessions of the
            copyrights so they can collect the royalties themself and later pay
            a agreed opon portion back to the writers/composers.

          <h3>REPERTOIRE</h3>
          <p>
            As you now might understand, the music industry is kind of a mess
            regarding to royalties. One of the biggest problems in the current
            system is that these PRO’s simply don’t know how to reach
            Songwriters and Composers because they aren’t known by the PRO’s.
            The problem is that these Songwriters and Composers do have the
            right to get payed. This is where Repertoire steps in. Repertoire
            want to address the entire flow from musical work, sound recordings,
            licensing and rights associated with payment flows. Their solution
            is a decentralized information management framework based on
            blockchain. If you want to learn more about Repertoire visit:

          <h2 class="section-heading">PRO</h2>
          <p>
            Now we have finally come down to the creation of the song, the job
            of the Songwriter and the Composer. When a Songwriter writes a song
            or a Componist composes a song they can sign with a Music publisher.
            There are a many different contracts they can sign. Contracts differ
            in services the Music publisher will do for the Songwriter and
            Composer. Of Course there will also be a difference in the
            percentage the Music publisher keeps for themselves. Traditionally
            the split is 50-50.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are more than one Songwriter or Composer the 50-50 split
            won’t become different. The Music publisher will still get 50%. So
            this means that the Songwriters or Composers will need to split
            their own 50% with each other. Say there are two Songwriters and one
            Music publisher and they split everything evenly, the new split will
            be 50(Music publisher)-25(Songwriter 1)-25(Songwriter 2).

            As you now might start to see, the music industry isn’t as easy and
            straightforward as you might have thought. The problem is that every
            artist big or small and every song has a different case and there
            really isn’t a standard format. This explanation has been very
            zoomed in on every individual of this story, but for a better
            overview this graphic might help!

            A big problem is that things aren’t carefully documented which
            results in a lot of lawsuits over who worked on a song. Because of
            this a lot of problems arise and often many Songwriters and
            Composers don’t get paid what they are entitled to. Repertoire
            strives to solve this by making it possible for Performers, Writers,
            Composers, Music publishers and Record labels record everything
            carefully and secure, making sure that everyone earns everything
            they deserve. If you want to learn more about Repertoire visit:
