            Congratulations, your song just made it onto Spotify. How exciting!
            With all this new found fame you’re probably already picturing
            yourself doing all kinds of cool stuff with all your hard earned
            money. But how does getting your money work? When are your royalties
            getting paid and how much is it going to be?

            That’s right, we won’t start from the beginning, where you actually
            wrote the song or recorded it. We will start with the finished song
            on Spotify, because we will follow the flow of the money back to
            you. Along the way we will come across all the different parties who
            worked hard to make this all happen.
